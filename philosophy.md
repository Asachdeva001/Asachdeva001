# Engineering Philosophy

I approach engineering as a long-term discipline, not short-term execution.

- Understand the system before optimizing it
- Favor composability and clean interfaces
- Design for scale even when building small
- Measure outcomes, not effort
- Write software that other engineers enjoy maintaining
